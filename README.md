## _This is a submission for [Frontend Challenge: Office Edition sponsored by Axero, CSS Art: Office Culture](https://dev.to/challenges/frontend/axero)._

## Inspiration

I wanted to create a modern, interactive office dashboard that captures the essence of a digital workplace. The design is inspired by real-world office portals, focusing on employee updates, HR resources, task management, and a clean, professional look. The goal was to blend utility with a visually appealing, CSS-driven layout that feels both productive and welcoming.

**Live Demo:**  
You can run the project locally by cloning the repo and running:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Journey

This project was built with React and CSS, focusing on a three-column layout:
- **Left Sidebar:** Collapsible quick actions for tasks, calendar, and widgets.
- **Center:** Company updates (like employee changes, Google Sheet edits, new tasks) and a sample widget (bar chart for open tickets, pending tasks, meetings).
- **Right Sidebar:** A responsive calendar (with today highlighted), a styled task list with filters, and HR resources.

**What I learned:**
- How to create a fully responsive, modern dashboard layout with pure CSS and React.
- How to build a simple calendar from scratch using JavaScript date logic and CSS grid.
- The importance of small UI details (collapsible sidebar, task cards, color coding) for a professional look.

**Proud of:**
- The clean, office-inspired design that adapts to all screen sizes.
- The interactive sidebar and visually clear task/calendar sections.
- The use of only CSS and React (no UI libraries) for all layout and art.

**Next steps:**
- Add more interactivity (drag-and-drop widgets, real data integration).
- Polish the calendar with month navigation.
- Add more CSS art elements (e.g., office-themed icons, avatars).
